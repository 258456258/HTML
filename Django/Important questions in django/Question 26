Explain Django architecture.

Django follows MVT (Model View Template) pattern. It is slightly different from MVC.

Model: It is the data access layer. It contains everything about the data, i.e., how to access it, how to validate it, its behaviors and the relationships between the data.

Let's see an example. We are creating a model Employee who has two fields first_name and last_name.

from django.db import models  
  
class Employee(models.Model):  
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)  
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
