Does Django support NoSQL?
NoSQL basically stands for “not only SQL”. This is considered as an alternative to the traditional RDBMS or the relational Databases.  Officially, Django does not support NoSQL databases. However, there are third-party projects, such as Django non-rel, that allow NoSQL functionality in Django. Currently, you can use MongoDB and Google App Engine.
