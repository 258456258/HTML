What does Django architecture look like?
A: Django architecture consists of:

Models. Describes the database schema and data structure
Views. Controls what a user sees. The view retrieves data from appropriate models, executes any calculations made, and passes it on to the template
Templates. Controls how the user sees the pages. It describes how the data received from the views needs to be altered or formatted to display on the page
Controller. Made up of the Django framework and URL parsing
